# SnE-Vnet

The configuration file can be used to either train or test the model. Currently, we have support for executing baseline models (Unet and VNet) and the presented model (Vnet-Sne).

Execute main.py to start the process. The configurations will be read from the config.yml file (a breakdown of each configuration is present within the file.). 
For the model-based configurations, refer to ConfigurationFiles/ModelConfigurations.yml.
